Because of that, we use the following approach (that was accepted by AMO reviewers):

1. We pre-build JS rules from AdGuard filters into the add-on (see the file called "local_script_rules.json").
2. At runtime we check every JS rule if it is included into "local_script_rules.json".
   If it is included we allow this rule to work since it is pre-built. Other rules are discarded.
3. We also allow "User rules" and "Custom filters" to work since those rules are added manually by the user.
   This way filters maintainers can test new rules before including them in the filters.`;

export const LOCAL_SCRIPT_RULES_COMMENT_CHROME_MV3 = ` To fully comply with Chrome Web Store policies regarding remote code execution,
 we implement a strict security-focused approach for JavaScript rule execution:

 1. For standard users (default mode):
    - We collect and pre-build script rules from the filters and statically bundle
      them into the extension - STEP 1. See 'updateLocalResourcesForChromiumMv3' in our build tools.
    - These pre-verified local scripts are passed to the engine - STEP 2.
    - At runtime, we check if each script rule is included in our local scripts list (STEP 3).
    - Only pre-verified local scripts are executed via chrome.scripting API (STEP 4.1 and 4.2).
      All other scripts are discarded.

 2. For advanced users with developer mode explicitly enabled:
    - JavaScript rules from custom filters can be executed using the browser's built-in
      userScripts API (STEP 4.3), which provides a secure sandbox.
    - This execution bypasses the local script verification process but remains
      isolated and secure through Chrome's native sandboxing.
    - This mode requires explicit user activation and is intended for advanced users only.

 This dual-path implementation ensures perfect compliance with Chrome Web Store policies
 while providing necessary functionality for users with different needs.`;
