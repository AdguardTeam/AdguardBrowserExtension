### How to become a beta tester?

### How to build

#### Requirements

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

Install local dependencies by runnning:
```
  yarn install
```

#### Download localizations

To run the task of downloading the localization files, put the `oneskyapp.json` configuration file in the root directory.

The configuration file looks like:

    {
        "url": "url of localizations",
        "project_id": "some id",
        "secret_key": "some key",
        "api_key": "some api key"
    }

For security reasons, this file is ignored by .gitignore settings.

To download and append localizations run:
```
  yarn locales-download
```

To upload new phrases to oneskyapp you need the same file `oneskyapp.json` and file with phrases `./Extension/_locales/en/messages.json`. Then run:
```
  yarn locales-upload
```

#### Building the dev version

Run the following command:
```
  yarn dev
```

This will create a Build directory with unpacked extensions for all browsers:
```
  Build/chrome-$currentVersion
  Build/firefox-$currentVersion
  Build/opera-$currentVersion
  Build/safari-$currentVersion.safariextension
```

#### Building the beta and release versions

Before building the release version, you should manually download necessary resources: filters and public suffix list.

```
  yarn resources
```

```
  yarn beta
  yarn release
```
You will need to put certificate.pem file to the Compiler directory. This build will create unpacked extensions and then pack them (crx for Chrome, xpi for Firefox).

### How to run tests
```
  yarn test
```
