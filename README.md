AdGuard is a fast and lightweight ad blocking browser extension that effectively blocks all types of ads and trackers on all web pages. We focus on advanced privacy protection features to not just block known trackers, but prevent web sites from building your shadow profile. Unlike its standalone counterparts (AG for Windows, Mac), the browser extension is completely free and open source. You can learn more about [the difference](https://adguard.com/compare.html) here.

> AdGuard does not collect any information about you, and does not participate in any acceptable ads program. The only source of income we have is selling premium versions of our software, and we intend to keep it that way.

<a id="dev-build"></a>
### How to build

**How to run tests**
```
  yarn test
```

**Building the dev version**

Run the following command:
```
  yarn dev
```

This will create a build directory with unpacked extensions for all browsers:
```
  build/dev/chrome
  build/dev/edge
  build/dev/firefox-amo
  build/dev/firefox-standalone
  build/dev/opera
```

**Building the beta and release versions**

Before building the release version, you should manually download necessary resources: filters and public suffix list.

```
  yarn resources
```

```
  CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=<password> yarn beta
  CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=<password> yarn release
```
You will need to put certificate.pem and mozilla_credentials.json files to the `./private` directory. This build will create unpacked extensions and then pack them (crx for Chrome, xpi for Firefox).

**Building the sample extension with API**

Run the following command:
```
yarn adguard-api
```
This will create a build directory with unpacked sample extension for chromium browsers:

```
build/dev/adguard-api
```
