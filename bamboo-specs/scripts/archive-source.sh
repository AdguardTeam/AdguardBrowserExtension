# Please do not move it to some common file, like `setup-tests.sh`, because sourcing A script from B script
# cannot change the options of B script.
#  -e: Exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status (i.e., if a command fails).
#  -x: Print each command to the terminal as it is executed, which is useful for debugging.
