/**
 * The main use case for this hook is to trigger a browser-generated confirmation
 * dialog depending on `blockCondition` flag that asks users to confirm if they really
 * want to leave the page when they try to close or reload it,
 * or navigate somewhere else (by manually typing url in search bar).
 * This is intended to help prevent loss of unsaved data.
 *
 * @param shouldPreventUnload If true, blocks unload of page and show browser-generated dialog.
 * @param browserDialogMessage Custom message for browser-generated dialog (Browser support list: https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_beforeunloadevent_returnvalue). Keep in mind that some browsers can support custom messages, but in fact can ignore that value.
