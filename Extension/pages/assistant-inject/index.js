/**
 * In the content script of tswebextension, we need access to @adguard/assistant
 * only when the user clicks 'block ad manually'.
 * Therefore, we exclude @adguard/assistant from the bundled content-script code
 * and load it on-demand. We also added a required field to the configuration
 * object to ensure the assistant is bundled inside the final extension,
 * allowing tswebextension to load it on-demand.
 *
 * Schema:
 * - Buildtime:
 *  -- [tswebext]  Script to inject assistant from the URL provided by the extension.
 *  -- [tswebext]  Assistant management script for interacting with the assistant.
 *  -- [tswebext]  Assistant messages listener on the content-script side.
 *  -- [extension] Entry point script for injecting the assistant <--- current file.
 * - Runtime:
 *  -- [tswebext] Content script injects into every new tab without the assistant.
 *  -- [tswebext] On-demand content script dynamically injects the assistant.
 *  -- [tswebext] After injection, the content script interacts with the assistant.
 *
 * Reference code: ASSISTANT_INJECT.
